Root cause analysis:
What is root cause analysis?
Root cause analysis (RCA) is the process of discovering the root causes of problems in order to identify appropriate solutions.

 Root cause analysis can be performed with a collection of principles, techniques, and methodologies that can all be leveraged to identify the root causes of an event or trend. Looking beyond superficial cause and effect, RCA can show where processes or systems failed or caused an issue in the first place.

Root cause analysis is used in software testing to identify defects. It's typically used to identify 
the cause of problems — and address that — instead of just treating the symptoms.

That means you can find the cause of software defects — before your customers find bugs.

What Is Root Cause Analysis?
Root Cause Analysis (RCA) is a technique used to find answers as to why a problem has happened.
 It works to name the origin of the problem using tools to follow a set of steps that identify the possible 
causes and then the primary cause of the issue. 

It’s a quality control measure that allows you to figure out what happened, understand why it occurred, 
and then begin to set up a process to reduce the chance of the same issue reoccurring.

RCA works on the basis that all systems and events are interconnected. One thing in a particular 
area triggers something else in another. The ability to trace back these interconnected triggers 
allows the person to see where the issue began and 
how it became the system that is now the main problem. It searches for patterns, finding flaws that 
are hidden within the system itself. It effectively shows a root cause or several causes of problems.

RCA identifies whether a defect was caused by a testing mistake, a development mistake, or 
maybe a requirement or design mistake.

It is crucial to figure this out, so releases done later will not have the defect as well.
 A design mistake allows someone to go over design documentation and make adjustments, as does 
if the defect was caused by a testing mistake. This is an instance of causal factor analysis.
